## Abstract
Women art historians have often remained unseen among the numerous layers of intellectual contributions constructing the field of art history. The image of the matryoshka conjures up the unwrapping of layers, uncovering what is underneath, what is inside. Peeling away the layers in the attempt of revealing the role of women in art history is the aim of this data-driven project that has been carried out for the exam of [Electronic Publishing and Digital Storytelling](https://www.unibo.it/it/didattica/insegnamenti/insegnamento/2020/443749) held by Professor Marilena Daquino, within the Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge course at the University of Bologna.

### Goal
The general objective of the project is to question the topic of gender of art history's professionals, in order to detect the existence of a gap in gender equality and visibility. This topic has been analyzed under different perspectives, exploiting linked open data as much as possible and taking advantage of the information available on [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) and additionally on the [ARTchives](http://artchives.fondazionezeri.unibo.it/) project, following a research principle that reflects the imagenery of the russian doll, which means going from the most general aspect to the most specific. 

### Research questions
- What is the state of gender representation in the field of art history?
- Is gender inequality influenced by geography? 
- How can we compute visibility?
- Has women's visibility evolved over time?
- What is the role that cultural institutions play in the visibility gap?
- Is the gap also detectable considering scholarly publications?
- Can we find a way for filling this gap?
